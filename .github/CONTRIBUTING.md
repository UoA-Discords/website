### Repository Structure

_TBC_

### Requirements

The minimum requirements for code contributions are:

1. The code _must_ be compliant with the configured [ESLint rules](../.eslintrc.json).
2. All new and changed code should _should_ have a corresponding unit and/or integration test, with 100% coverage.
3. [Status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) _must_ pass for the latest commit within your PR.
